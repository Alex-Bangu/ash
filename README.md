# ash
Alex SHell, also known as ASH, is a Shell that imitates Bash. This shell is entirely written by... me.

You can use this shell as a replacement of Bash, although I do not recommend it if you're not using it for personal use/fun (also I'm sure there's plenty of more advanced things that Bash does which ASH can't (as of right now)).

There is almost 100% some security issues in here. Do not use ASH for anything besides messing around and having fun.

There are several builtins I personally implemented, but by default ASH will use the implementations it finds in /bin.

To use my implementations of built in functions, being echo, cat, wc, and ls, simply add '\_my' as a suffix. For example, to use ls, type ls\_my. I also implemented cd, but you don't need to add '\_my' to use it.

I'll continue to update this file as I add things to ASH.
