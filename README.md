# ash
Alex SHell, also known as ASH, is a Shell that imitates Bash. This shell is entirely created by me, Alex.

It's important to note that the flags used in the Makefile will only work on Linux machines. If you want to use the Makefile on mac then feel free to add whatever flags you want, or omit them entirely.

On that note, to actually make the executable, you should use the Makefile.
